The SLR Alphabet Recognizer is a machine learning project that recognizes sign language alphabets using a convolutional neural network model based on TensorFlowâ€™s InceptionV3. Built with Python, OpenCV, and Docker, this project enables training and testing on a dataset of hand signs. The recognizer can classify sign images or even recognize gestures via webcam for a live demo. Check the repository for instructions on training the model and running classification tests with images or webcam. For more details, visit the GitHub repository.
