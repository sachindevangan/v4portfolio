A React-based Single Page Application (SPA) using the Metropolitan Museum of Art API. This project integrates pagination, routing, and data fetching with Axios, displaying artwork details from the museum's collection. The application supports navigating through a collection of art pieces, viewing individual item details, and optionally, searching for specific artwork. Material-UI is used to enhance the UI, and async/await is implemented for optimized data handling.
