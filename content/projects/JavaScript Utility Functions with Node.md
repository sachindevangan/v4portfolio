A set of utility functions implemented in JavaScript, organized in modules for arrays, strings, and objects.
Each function has strict error handling and validation. Includes testing with both passing and failing cases for
each function in an app.js file. Functions include array sorting and filtering, merging, and matrix multiplication,
as well as string and object utilities such as palindrome checking, word censoring, object equality checking, and more.
