A GraphQL client application built using either React or Next.js that connects to a GraphQL server for
querying and managing authors and books. The application utilizes Apollo Client for managing GraphQL queries and
mutations, including creating, updating, and deleting authors and books, with additional functionality for searching
books by genre, price range, and authors by name. Material-UI is used for UI components.
