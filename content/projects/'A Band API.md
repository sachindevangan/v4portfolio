A RESTful API project that provides CRUD operations to manage data for music bands and their albums, implementing MongoDB for data persistence. Organized using modular programming practices, this API separates database management, data manipulation, and routing. Built with complete error handling and input validation, it leverages asynchronous programming to efficiently handle database operations.
