This project focuses on a client-side text analysis application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It runs entirely in the browser and provides various text statistics, leveraging an Express server solely to serve the HTML page and assets. Core functionality includes transforming user-entered text into lowercase and calculating multiple metrics such as letter count, vowel count, word count, and more. Each calculation dynamically updates on the page without server processing.
