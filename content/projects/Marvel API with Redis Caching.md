A Marvel API project that demonstrates usage of Redis caching in an Express.js server. The project allows users to retrieve character, comic, and story data from the Marvel API with efficient caching to optimize repeated queries. Utilizing asynchronous operations, the server checks Redis for cached data before making external API requests, minimizing API calls and improving response time.
