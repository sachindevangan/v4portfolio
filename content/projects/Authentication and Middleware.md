This project involves creating a secure authentication system with Express.js, implementing user sign-up and login features. It includes password hashing, role-based access control, and session management using express-session. A logging middleware is also incorporated to track requests and their status. The project emphasizes client-side and server-side validation, error handling, and user role restrictions across various routes.
