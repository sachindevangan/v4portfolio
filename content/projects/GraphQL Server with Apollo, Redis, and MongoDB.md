A GraphQL API project using Apollo Server, Redis, and MongoDB to manage and cache data for authors and books. The server supports a variety of queries and mutations, including data retrieval, addition, and modification, with Redis caching to optimize response time and minimize database load. The API establishes data relationships between authors and books, providing nested data queries and computed fields for enriched data handling.
